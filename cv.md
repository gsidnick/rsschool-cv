## About Me
I am an enthusiastic Full-stack Developer from Krasnodar, Russia. I like
to develop useful, convenient and attractive web applications for users.

I am interested in a wide range of knowledge, ranging from UX/UI to frontend
and backend. I am also developing my design skills to create harmonious and
modern user interfaces. Thus, I am interested in creating an application at all
stages of its development - creating a design project in Figma, developing
a layout using HTML and CSS (including the SCSS pre-processor), implementing
frontend functionality in JavaScript, developing a backend on Node.JS .
In addition, I use Webpack for production builds of the project, as well as
the Git version control system. I am improving my knowledge of TypeScript in
order to migrate my projects to this strictly typed programming language in
the future. At the moment, I'm studying React - a JavaScript library for
creating user interfaces.

Using JavaScript as an elegant language for client-side and server-side
development, I'm getting deeper and deeper into the programming process.
Therefore, I am proud to say that the level of my knowledge at the moment
is the result of my many years of self-education from scratch.
